- The Ticket is valid only for the event and seat for which it was issued and cannot be refunded, exchanged or replaced if lost, stolen or otherwise destroyed;
- Management reserves the right, without refunding any amount paid for the Ticket, to refuse admission or reject a Holder (a) whose conduct violates any law/regulation and/or Management's rules vis-a-vis the premises, or deemed by management as unruly, or poses a clear and present danger to the public, or (b) who uses vulgar or abusive language, or (c) for any analogous reason. The Holder's breach of the foregoing laws/regulations/rules constitutes an automatic revocation of this license without refund;
- The Holder agrees not to record/transmit or aid in the recording/transmitting of any description, account, picture or reproduction of the Event.

- The Holder's breach of any of the terms of the Ticket or failure to comply with the Venue rules shall automatically terminate whatever rights the Holder may have under this license and shall render the Holder's use hereof for any of the purpose illegal or unauthorized. In such cases, ACROSYS, the Venue, or the Seller shall have the right to withdraw the Ticket, refuse the Holder's admission into the Venue or otherwise eject the Holder from the Venue. Further, the Holder shall be subject to all other legal remedies available to ACROSYS, the Venue, the Seller or the Event sponsors;
